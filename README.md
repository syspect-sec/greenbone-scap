The **greenbone-scap** Python package is a collection of utilities and tools to
download the CPE and CVE information from the [NIST NVD REST API](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers)
into a PostgreSQL database.

## Installation

### Requirements

Python 3.11 and later is supported.

### Install using pipx

You can install the latest stable release of **greenbone-scap** from the [Python
Package Index (pypi)][pypi] using [pipx]

    python3 -m pipx install greenbone-scap

### Install using pip

> [!NOTE]
> The `pip install` command does no longer work out-of-the-box in newer
> distributions like Ubuntu 23.04 because of [PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668).
> Please use the [installation via pipx](#install-using-pipx) instead.

You can install the latest stable release of **greenbone-scap** from the [Python
Package Index (pypi)][pypi] using [pip]

    python3 -m pip install --user greenbone-scap

## Usage

The **greenbone-scap** Python package provides three tools,

* `greenbone-cve-download` to download all CVE information from NIST NVD into
  a PostgreSQL database,
* `greenbone-cpe-download` to download all CPE information from NIST NVD into a
  PostgreSQL database and
* `greenbone-cpe-find` to search for specific CPEs in the PostgreSQL database.

All three tools require to setup a PostgreSQL database to work correctly. The
parameters for the PostgreSQL database like host, port, username and password
can be set via environment variables or passed as CLI arguments.

## Docker Compose

The tools are easiest to use via the provided [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
[file](./docker/compose.yml). For a quick setup the following commands can be
used:

```sh
cd docker
echo "DATABASE_PASSWORD=my-super-safe-password" > .env
docker compose up
```

Additionally a [NIST API key](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key)
can be used to extend the rate limits for the download.

```sh
echo "NVD_API_KEY=my-nist-api-key" >> .env
```

On the first startup all CPE and CVE information will be downloaded. This will
take some hours depending on your network connection and the server reliability
at NIST. On the next startup only the changed and new CPEs and CVEs since the
previous startup are updated or created.

To only download CPEs run `docker compose up cpe` and to only download CVEs
`docker compose up cve`.

To re-download and re-update all CPE and CVE information the data volume can be
deleted by running `docker volume rm greenbone-scap_data`.

To restart from scratch all containers have to be shutdown and the volumes have
to be removed. This can be done by running `docker compose down -v`.

## Command Completion

`greenbone-scap` comes with support for command line completion in bash and zsh.
All greenbone-scap CLI commands support shell completion. As examples the
following sections explain how to set up the completion for `greenbone-cve-download`
with bash and zsh.

### Setup for bash

```bash
echo "source ~/.greenbone-cve-download-complete.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
greenbone-cve-download --print-completion bash > ~/.greenbone-cve-download-complete.bash
```

Alternatively, you can use the result of the completion command directly with
the eval function of your bash shell:

```bash
eval "$(greenbone-cve-download --print-completion bash)"
```

### Setup for zsh

```zsh
echo 'fpath=("$HOME/.zsh.d" $fpath)' >> ~/.zsh
mkdir -p ~/.zsh.d/
greenbone-cve-download --print-completion zsh > ~/.zsh.d/_greenbone_cve_download
```

Alternatively, you can use the result of the completion command directly with
the eval function of your zsh shell:

```bash
eval "$(greenbone-cve-download --print-completion zsh)"
```

## Development

**greenbone-scap** uses [poetry] for its own dependency management and build
process.

First install poetry via [pipx]

    python3 -m pipx install poetry

Afterwards run

    poetry install

in the checkout directory of **greenbone-scap** (the directory containing the
`pyproject.toml` file) to install all dependencies including the packages only
required for development.

Afterwards activate the git hooks for auto-formatting and linting via
[autohooks].

    poetry run autohooks activate

Validate the activated git hooks by running

    poetry run autohooks check
